# Overview

LabVIEW demos and solutions using Wasatch Photonics spectrometers.

# Dependencies

The LabVIEW demo requires the following DLLs, both available from 
[Wasatch.NET](https://github.com/WasatchPhotonics/Wasatch.NET/tree/master/lib):

* WasatchNET.dll
* LibUsbDotNet.dll

It also requires .INF files to associate Wasatch Photonics spectrometers
with LibUSB.NET.  Right now, the easiest way to do that is to install
Enlighten or Dash, one of our standard spectroscopy GUIs.
